# classroomCode

This repository contains various programming codes and scripts used in the classes I teach. The codes cover a range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, digital systems, and more. They are designed to provide practical examples and exercises for students, supporting learning through hands-on implementation. Feel free to explore, contribute, and use the materials for educational purposes.
